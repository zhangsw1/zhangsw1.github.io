PetPal is a dog social media I created for my dog Gatsby.
I had my first puppy last year, and it was frustrated to do dog playdate. I took him to my community's dog park couple times, however when dogs get excited and puppies get nervous. PetPal is perfect for dog owners to solve the problem. 

Recently I'm using React Hooks to add feature which is checking shelter animals in either SF or Seattle area (Acknoledgements: Frontend Master)
